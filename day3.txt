Process Management

- Process Definition: Program in execution
- To enable the functionality of the program (set of instruction), all the necessary steps are processes. (set of activities)
- Program loaded into main memory is process.

CPU is running the process-
Process parts:
- Stack (stores : member function, parameters, return type, local variables) Temporary Memory
- Heap (function : Dynamic Memory Allocation)
- text (has : Program Counter (PC), Register (Accumulator, base register))
- Data (global variables, static variables (fixed value))

#The Process Model (How Processes are organized)
-

Process States and Process Transition :
- New
- Ready
- Running
- Terminated
- Block/Wait

- Process Contral Block :
    - It contains everything that the process does
    - It is a data structure maintainted by OS for each process. It lies in kernel memory space.
    - It contians :
        - Process ID
        - State
        - Pointer (Points towards its child processes)
        - Priority
        - Program Counter
        - CPU Registers
        - I/O information
        - Accounting Information (How much time is left for each process to complete after every state change)
        - etc..

    - The data changes dynamically

- Context Switching :
- Operation on Process (Creation, Termination, Hierarchies, Implementation)
    Creation:
        - System Initialization
        - Using fork (UNIX), Create-Process or other system call when a parent process creates a child process
        - User's request to create new process
        - Initiation of a batch job
    
    Termination :
        - Normal Complete (Work Finished)
        - Error exit
        - Fatal error, due to bugs
        - kill process

    Hierarchies : Unix has hierarchical structure for proces management, but Windows doesn't have.
        When a process is created, the parent process is gicen a special token called handle, which is used to control child processes.

    Implementation :
        - OS implements the process model by the means of process table, with one entry per process
        - Each entries of the table are called proces control blocks (PCB)
        - PCB has log records to recover from unprecedented events
