Important topics chapter 1 - Multiprogramming, multiprocessing, multitasking
Types of OS:
- Batch OS:
    Major advantage - similar types of jobs can be batched into one and executed
    Disadvantages - The user cannot directly communicate with the OS as two layes such as punch card and operator 
    Example - Payroll System, Bank Statement

Note: In Multiprogramming and multitasking, there is only one processor
- Multiprogramming OS:
    Multiple progarms line up in queue  at one point of time, the OS allocates resources (CPU doesn't remain idle). It is non-preemptive
    Advantage - High CPU utilization, efficient memory utilization (Only one program doesn't gobble up the memory), high CPU throughput (no. of process executed per unit time) (multipe interactive user temrinals)
    Disadvantages - CPU scheduling is compulsary (lots of jobs are ready to run on CPU) Taking maximum response time to execute (Since there is no vacant slot for a program after it redirecting to input or other, there exists an starvation problem) 
    - since it is non-preemptive (no priority and executes on first come first out method) preemptive (priority aanusar execute garne)

- Time Sharing (MultiTasking) :
    Every process is allocated equal quanta of time. (JO suru ma aayo tesle remainder time pauxa, example if a process takes 4s to execute and another takes 3s and other takes 5s, and the quanta is 4s than the first progarm runs for 4s and then another runs for 3 and the remaining is given to the first program not to the third one)

- Multiprocessing operationg system :
    In multiprocessing, there are multiple processor
    multiple CPUs communicate with different processors using a shared memory. (if a program takes 2hr to complete, then the OS will breakdown the program into multiple subprocesses and using shared memory, each cores will execute the program, taking less time to execute)
    
    Types of multiprocessing:
    - Symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) OS - (all have equal authority level)
    - Asymmetric multiprocessing (AMP) OS - two types of prcossor (main CPU is master and other cores are slaves, however master checks the final execution)

Note: All thes types are only one computer and either one or multiple CPUs

- Distributed OS :
    multiple computers interacted through a communication channel  (OS acts as a intermediate)

- Real Time OS:
    OS with QUick Response time
    Types: 
        Hard Real TIme OS (guarentees quick response)
        Soft Real Time OS (tries to provide quick response)
    
Generation of OS:
-First (Vacuum TUbes and Pligboards, no OS)
-Second (Transistors, Batch OS)
-Third (IC, multiprogramming OS)
Fourth (present, DOS, Windows, Linux)
